`2019` [Regresso](https://js13kgames.com/entries/regresso) ⛵️ The tale of a crew trying to return to the seas and escape misfortune.

`2018` [Signalmon](https://js13kgames.com/entries/signalmon) 🍖 A tamagochi-like game for mobile browsers. Signalmon has 3 basic needs: Food, Sleep, Fun.

`2017` [Hoosdere](https://js13kgames.com/entries/hoosdere) 🐺 A spooky game where you're trying to escape from a forest full of creatures. And the visual effects are made with CSS and very poorly executed. Controls are also very buggy.
